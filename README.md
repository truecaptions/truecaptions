# Truecaptions

Truecaptions is an AI content validation platform that helps identify artificially generated text, images, video, and audio. Our mission is to bring transparency to online content creation by detecting synthetic media and verifying authentic user-created content.

## Key Features

- **Text validator**: Our advanced natural language processing can analyze text and determine if it was written by a human or an AI system like ChatGPT. We check for signs of computer-generated responses.
- **Image insights**: Upload an image to our platform and we'll examine it for indicators that it was made by an AI image generator like DALL-E or Stable Diffusion.
- **Video analysis (coming soon)**: We are developing technology to watch videos and assess if they were generated by deepfake algorithms or other AI synthesizers.
- **Audio validation (coming soon)**: Truecaptions will be able to listen to audio clips and flag ones that were created with voice cloning or other AI audio generators.

## Our Technology

We use cutting-edge machine learning and neural networks to identify the subtle clues that give away AI-fabricated content. Our models are custom-developed and trained on the latest synthetic media to stay on top of the most sophisticated generative technology.

As content creation AI continues to advance, we are committed to continuously updating Truecaptions' validation capabilities to detect even highly advanced autonomously created text, images, video, and audio.

## Usage

Truecaptions offers both free and premium application interfaces (APIs) to integrate our validation technology into your platform. See our API documentation to get started.

You can also try our tools through our website interface at [truecaptions.com](https://truecaptionsai.vercel.app/). Simply submit text, upload an image or provide a link to a video or audio file.

## About Us

Truecaptions was founded in 2023 by two software engineers concerned about the potential proliferation of deepfakes and other AI content online. We believe accurate detection of synthetic media is essential for maintaining trust in online platforms.
